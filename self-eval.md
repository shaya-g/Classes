# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt pretty confident in completing this CFU, however, I did get stuck on the last Hobbit challenge, but then with the help of Hazel and another cohort member, I was able to figure it out! I am pretty proud of myself because I did almost all of the code by myself, I just was missing one semi-colon! It is crazy how one mistake can ruin your whole code!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow is going really well! I allow myself to take breaks after each section is completed so that I can start with a fresh mind and perspective.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to be kind with myself and not get too frustrated when I am not able to find the solution right away. I also need to have my desk prepared with plenty of snacks, water, and caffeine. I also need to feel more comfortable with reaching out for help.
